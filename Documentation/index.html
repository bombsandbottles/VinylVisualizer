<p>This is a bunch of text documenting your final project. It is a userâ€™s manual for 
your application. Although the structure of your documentation is entirely up to you, 
it should be incredibly clear to the instructor how your project is to be installed, 
how it can be configured, and how it can be used. Your documentation should be at 
least several paragraphs in length, if not several pages. It should not be necessary 
for us to contact you with questions regarding your project after its submission. 
Be sure to answer in your documentation any questions you think we might have while 
testing your work.
