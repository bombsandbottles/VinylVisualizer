Final Project Closing Remarks

This final project and entire class was a fantastic experience for me.  I can confidently say 
that I don't remember the last time I learned so much in such a short duration of time.  Reading
my initial proposal I did not intentionally mean to discard the FFT element of the visualization.
Rather I couldn't figure out a "nice" way to draw both the amplitude and frequency modulation on top
of each other keeping with the Vinyl/disc theme.  I initially struggled with getting the audio effects
to work.  However with the help of Uri I got them to work perfectly and learned a ton in the process.
My favorite moment from the project was figuring out a way to smooth the sample rate conversion
effect when the resulting number of frames to be read in was not exactly divisible by the 
number of output frames to be generated.

I accomplished a smoothing with this code: 
/* This if Statement Ensures Smooth VariSpeed Output */
    if (fmod((double)framesPerBuffer, data->src_data.src_ratio) == 0)
    {
    	numInFrames = framesPerBuffer;
    }
    else
    	numInFrames = (framesPerBuffer/data->src_data.src_ratio) + 2;

I continue to keep experimenting and developing the VinlyVisualizer in my spare time,
adding both visual and audio effects and incorporating the FFT portion.
